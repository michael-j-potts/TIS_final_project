Limited-overs form of the sport of cricket List A cricket is a classification of the limited-overs (one-day) form of the sport of cricket , with games lasting up to eight hours. List A cricket includes One Day International (ODI) matches and various domestic competitions in which the number of overs in an innings per team ranges from forty to sixty, as well as some international matches involving nations who have not achieved official ODI status. Together with first-class and Twenty20 cricket, List A is one of the three major forms of cricket recognised by the International Cricket Council (ICC). In November 2021, the ICC retrospectively applied List A status to women's cricket, aligning it with the men's game.

The scheduled number of overs in List A cricket ranges from forty to sixty overs per side, mostly fifty overs. The categorisation of cricket matches as "List A" was not officially endorsed by the International Cricket Council until 2006, when the ICC announced that it, along with its member associations, would be determining this classification in a manner similar to that done for first-class matches. The Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians created this category for the purpose of providing an equivalent to first-class cricket, to allow the generation of career records and statistics for comparable one-day matches. Only the more important one-day competitions in each country, plus matches against a touring Test team, are included. The categorisation was the work of Philip Bailey. Matches were divided into three categories: List A comprised the matches to be included in the final list. List B was for matches where the players were of First-Class standard but the match was not considered to be of sufficient status (e.g. exhibition matches). List C was to collect any other matches played by a team that had at some time previously appeared in List A, thus showing that the status of such matches had not been overlooked.
