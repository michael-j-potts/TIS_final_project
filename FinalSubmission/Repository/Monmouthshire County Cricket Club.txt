The county was usually among the weakest in the Minor Counties competition, and only for a few seasons in the 1900s did it finish in the top half of the final table. In 1905, Monmouthshire's best season, the county came second to Norfolk. After 1934, neighbouring Glamorgan , which had risen to first-class status in 1921, played fairly regularly at grounds within the Monmouthshire borders, including the county ground at Rodney Parade , Newport .
