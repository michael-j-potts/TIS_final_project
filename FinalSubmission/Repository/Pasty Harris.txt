Contents 1 Early life 2 Playing career 3 Umpiring career 4 References 5 External links Early life [ edit ] Harris was born in St Just in Roseland , Cornwall , in 1944. His nickname of " Pasty " referred to his Cornish origins. Playing career [ edit ] In England he represented Nottinghamshire , for whom he scored over 15,000 runs, and Middlesex County Cricket Club , playing as a right-handed batsman and, from 1969 until around 1972, as a useful leg spin bowler. From 1974 to 1977, Nottinghamshire used him as their wicketkeeper, as David Pullan , the incumbent, was a poor batsman. Harris hit nine centuries, equalling the county record, in 1971 when he scored 2238 runs. In 1974, Harris was selected to tour Rhodesia with the International Wanderers, a private touring team organised by Brian Close . A prolific batsman in county cricket, he was selected on standby for the 1974–75 Ashes tour but was superseded by Colin Cowdrey . Umpiring career [ edit ] Harris later became an umpire, officiating at List A level from 1985 to 2008 and at First class level from 1988 to 2008. References [ edit ] ^ "Mike Harris" .
