The present Staffordshire county club was founded on 24 November 1871 and took part in the first National Counties Cricket Championship in 1895. It then lapsed for four years as it could not arrange sufficient fixtures, but has been a member continuously since 1900. Staffordshire has won the National Counties Championship 11 times, more than any other county. It won the title outright in 1906, 1908, 1911, 1920, 1921, 1927, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1998 and 2014. The 1914 title was disputed as the war prevented several matches from being played, and is regarded by the NCCA as void. Staffordshire's years of great success before and after the First World War were in part due to the great bowler, Sydney Barnes , who played for the county from 1904 to 1914 and from 1924 to 1934 (when he was 61). He took 1,441 wickets at an average of 8.15 runs each. However, Barnes did not play for the county in 1920 or 1921, two of Staffordshire's title-winning seasons. The leading player then was Aaron Lockett . The most recent title in 2014 was won after a play-off final against the Western Division league leaders, Wiltshire , at the South Wilts Sports Club ground in Salisbury. Staffordshire has won the NCCA Knockout Trophy twice (1991 and 1993) since its inception in 1983.
