The parish had a population of 26,783 at the 2011 census. The town grew around a ford on the River Lea , near its confluences with the rivers Mimram , Beane , and Rib . The Lea is navigable from the Thames up to Hertford. Fortified settlements were established on each side of the ford at Hertford in 913 AD. The county of Hertfordshire was established at a similar time, being named after and administered from Hertford. Hertford Castle was built shortly after the Norman Conquest in 1066 and remained a royal residence until the early seventeenth century. Hertfordshire County Council and East Hertfordshire District Council both have their main offices in the town and are major local employers, as is McMullen's Brewery , which has been based in the town since 1827. The town is also popular with commuters, being only 20 miles (32 km) north of central London and connected to it by two railway lines.

Herut is the Old English spelling of hart , meaning a fully mature stag ; thus the meaning of the name is a ford where harts are found. The Domesday Book of 1086 gives a spelling of Hertforde . History [ edit ] Hertford Castle One possible earlier mention of the town was in 673 AD: the first synod of a number of the bishops in England was held either in Hertford or at Hartford, Cambridgeshire . The synod was called by Theodore of Tarsus ; decisions included the calculation of the date of Easter. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records that in 913 AD, Edward the Elder ordered the construction of two burhs (earthwork fortifications) either side of the ford over the River Lea at Hertford as part of his campaign against the Danes . By the time of the Domesday Book , Hertford had two churches, two markets and three mills. The Normans began work on Hertford Castle , and Hertford Priory was founded by Ralph de Limesy . King Henry II rebuilt the castle in stone, but in 1216, during the First Barons' War , it was besieged and captured after 25 days by Prince Louis of France . The castle was regularly visited by English royalty and in 1358, Queen Isabella , wife of Edward II , died there. The priory was dissolved in 1536 and subsequently demolished and in 1563, the Parliament of England met at the castle because of an outbreak of plague in London. Hertford grew and prospered as a market and county town ; communication was improved by the construction of the Lea Navigation Canal in 1767 and the arrival of the railway in 1843. The Port Hill drill hall was completed in 1898 and Yeomanry House was brought into military use in 1910. Governance [ edit ] Hertford has three tiers of local government at parish (town), district, and county level: Hertford Town Council, East Hertfordshire District Council , and Hertfordshire County Council , all three of which are based in the town. Hertford Ancient borough (c. 913–1835) Municipal borough (1836–1974) Coat of arms Population • 1901 9,322 • 1971 19,540 History • Created c. 913 (Ancient borough) 1 January 1836 (Municipal borough) • Abolished 31 March 1974 • Succeeded by East Hertfordshire • HQ Hertford Contained within • County Council Hertfordshire Hertford has been the county town of Hertfordshire since the county was founded in Saxon times. The town also gave its name to the hundred of Hertford . The town was initially governed by the king's reeves . By the thirteenth century, the reeves had been replaced by a bailiff , elected by the burgesses . Charters of 1554 and 1589 established a common council of eleven chief burgesses and a bailiff. Another charter of 1605 changed the bailiff's title to mayor. Under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835 , Hertford became a Municipal borough ; the ratepayers elected twelve councillors , who chose four aldermen , with the aldermen and councillors together composing the council (also known as the corporation), which elected the mayor. The Hertford poor law union was established in 1835, covering the town and surrounding rural parishes. Hertford Corporation used part of the Shire Hall as a Town Hall until 1911, when it moved into the surviving gatehouse of Hertford Castle . Under the Local Government Act 1972 , Hertford Municipal Borough was abolished, merging with other districts to become part of the district of East Hertfordshire with effect from 1 April 1974. A successor parish was created covering the former borough of Hertford, with its parish council taking the name Hertford Town Council. The town council is based at the former offices of the borough corporation at Hertford Castle. The headquarters of Hertfordshire County Council is at County Hall , built in 1939 to replace the Shire Hall. East Hertfordshire District Council's offices almost adjoin County Hall, being at Wallfields, which prior to 1974 had been the offices of Hertford Rural District Council . Arms [ edit ] From at least 1634, Hertford Corporation used an escutcheon (shield) depicting a hart above water to indicate a ford. The borough council was granted the right to complement its arms with a badge in 1925, and supporters were added in 1937. The coat of arms is now used by Hertford Town Council. Coat of arms of Hertford Town Council Escutcheon Argent on water barry wavy a hart lodged Proper (recorded at the 1634 visitation). Supporters On either side a lion Ermine gorged with a collar pendent therefrom by a chain Gules an escutcheon Or charged with three chevrons also Gules (granted 20th October 1937). Motto Pride In Our Past Faith In Our Future Geography [ edit ] Hertford is at the confluence of four river valleys: the Rib , Beane and Mimram join the River Lea at Hertford to flow east and then south toward the Thames as the Lee Navigation , after Hertford Castle Weir . The shared valley of the Lea and the Beane is called Hartham Common and this provides a large park to one side of the town centre running towards Ware and lying below the ridge upon which Bengeo is situated. The town centre still has its medieval layout with many timber-framed buildings hidden under later frontages, particularly in St Andrew Street . Hertford suffers from traffic problems despite the existence of the 1960s A414 bypass called Gascoyne Way which passes close to the town centre. Plans have long existed to connect the A10 with the A414, by-passing the town completely. Nevertheless, the town retains very much a country-town feel, despite lying only 19.2 miles (30.9 km) north of Central London . This is aided by its proximity to larger towns such as Harlow , Bishop's Stortford and Stevenage where modern development has been focused. Suburbs and estates Bengeo Foxholes Estate Horns Mill Pinehurst, Hertford Rush Green Sele Farm Nearby Hertford Hertford Heath Hertingfordbury Waterford Hartham Common Economy [ edit ] Hertfordshire County Hall in Hertford A fair amount of employment in the town is centred on County Hall ( Hertfordshire County Council ), Wallfields ( East Hertfordshire District Council ) and McMullens Brewery , one of a dwindling number of independent pre-1970 family brewers in the United Kingdom. Many residents commute to work in London. Hertford differs from neighbouring towns as it lacks a modern shopping development (mall). However, it has most of the usual supermarkets. A Tesco store occupies part of the former Christ's Hospital Bluecoat Girls School, which closed down in 1985. Sainsbury's opened a new store on part of the McMullens Brewery site in June 2012. A Waitrose occupied a reasonably large store in the Bircherley Green Shopping area that closed on 12 September 2017. The local branch of Woolworths closed for good on 27 December 2008, after the collapse of that store chain. There are fewer of the usual chain shops found in most high streets and this makes Hertford stand out from other " clone towns ". There are a high number of independent shops in the town, with a variety of boutiques and salons. Sport and leisure [ edit ] Hertford has a leisure centre and swimming pool, skatepark,  bowling green and tennis courts on Hartham Common . Football [ edit ] There is a Non-League football club Hertford Town F.C. , which plays at Hertingfordbury Park. Hertford Town Youth FC , a FA Charter Standard Football Club , play at County Hall Playing Fields, situated next to the headquarters of Hertfordshire County Council at County Hall in Hertford. Other clubs surrounding the town include Bury Rangers , Hertford Heath Youth FC and Bengeo Tigers Football Club (an award-winning FA Charter Standard Community Football Club . ) Cricket [ edit ] Hertford Cricket Club is an English amateur cricket club, located in Hertford, the county town of Hertfordshire . Cricket records for a Hertford club go back a far as 1825, however the club in its present form has been in existence since 1860. The club plays its matches at Balls park, Hertford. Currently the club runs five teams and all the teams play in the local league.

The castle's gatehouse, the central part of which dates to a rebuild by Edward IV in 1463, is the home to Hertford Town Council. The Motte, from the original Motte and Bailey castle in Hertford, can be found just behind Castle Hall, a short distance from the modern castle. There are several churches in the town, All Saints' , and St Andrew's , are late and mid 19th century respectively, although both stand on the sites of medieval places of worship. In the northern suburb of Bengeo lies St Leonard's , a two-celled Norman church of considerable architectural interest. In Railway Street can be found the oldest purpose-built Quaker Meeting House in the world, in use since 1670. Hertford Quaker Meeting House The Parliament of England temporarily moved to Hertford during a plague outbreak in London in 1563. This is why the main square in the town, Parliament Square, is so named, although it is a twentieth-century creation. The home of Alfred Russel Wallace (see above), now named Wallace House, can be found at 11 St. Andrew St. and is marked with a plaque. Built in 1779, the Shire Hall was designed by Robert Adam . The ground floor houses Court Rooms. The Hertford Corn Exchange was built on the site of a former gaol. After years in the doldrums it has now reverted to being a live entertainment venue.

It was a grocery store from the Victorian era until the 1960s, and is currently a restaurant. In Cowbridge, there is a Prince Albert Cottage . The first of these cottages was originally built in Hyde Park by the Society for Improving the Condition of the Labouring Classes in 1851 at the time of the Great Exhibition . Prince Albert was involved in their design and financing. Hertford Museum is housed in a 17th-century historic town house, with a Jacobean-style knot garden .

Town twinning [ edit ] See also: List of twin towns and sister cities in the United Kingdom Évron , France Wildeshausen , Germany Hartford , Connecticut , United States Notes [ edit ] ^ The Hertford built-up area sub division defined by the Office for National Statistics covers a similar, but not identical, area to the parish, and had a population in the 2011 census of 26,658. ^ Some sources differ on the date of the founding of the burhs. Stenton (1943) gives the date as 911 whilst Williamson (2000) gives it as 912. Ingram (1823), Giles (1847), Thorpe (1861) and Rook (1997) agree on 913. Page (1912) uses "about 913". All derive their view from different interpretations and translations of the various surviving versions (A to F) of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle: Text A (Winchester) gives the year (in Roman numerals) as 913, but several dates around this section seem to have been adjusted later, and it appears that the year was originally written as 912. The numerals for 914 to 916 also appear in the margin alongside the entry concerning Hertford. Text B (Abingdon I) does not date the years around this time, but the text clearly marks the start of the entry for each year. A later hand has added dates in the margin, assigning 913 to the entry concerning Hertford. Texts C (Abingdon II) and D (Worcester) both unambiguously assign the year 913 to the Hertford entry. Texts E (Peterborough) and F (Canterbury) both have gaps for the years around this time. The four texts which mention the fortification of Hertford agree that the northern burh was founded around St. Martin's Day (or Martinmas), and the southern burh built between the following rogationtide and midsummer. All four texts present these events within a single paragraph, without indicating that a new year has started. Some sources take this to mean that the northern burh was built around the feast of St Martin of Tours on 11 November and the southern burh in the spring of the following year. Thorpe (1861) proposed that the St Martin's Day in question was more likely to be 14 April, which was formerly marked as the anniversary of St Martin the Confessor , which would place the construction of the northern burh around April and the southern burh in May and June of the same year.
