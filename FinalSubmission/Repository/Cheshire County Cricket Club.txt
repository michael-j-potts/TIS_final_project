As advised by the Association of Cricket Statisticians (ACS), the earliest known reference to the sport being played in the county has been found in the Manchester Journal dated Saturday, 1 September 1781. It concerned an eleven-a-side match played the previous Monday, 27 August, at Brinnington Moor between a team of printers and one representing the villages of Haughton and Bredbury , who were the winners. As Haughton was then in Lancashire , the match is the earliest reference for that county too. Origin of club [ edit ] According to Wisden there was a county organisation as early as 1819. The present club was founded on 29 September 1908 and entered the Minor Counties Championship for the first time the following year, 1909.

Cheshire has won the Minor Counties Championship five times, and twice shared the title. It won the title outright in 1967, 1985, 1988, 2007 and 2013. It shared the accolade in 2001 with Lincolnshire and in 2005 with Suffolk . Cheshire has won the MCCA Knockout Trophy three times since its inception in 1983. It won in 1983, 1987 and 1996.
