The earliest reference to cricket in the county is dated 1745. The first county match played by the team was Norfolk v Suffolk at Bury St Edmunds Race Course on Thursday 23 August 1764, which was won by Norfolk.  This was reported in the Gazetteer & London Daily Advertiser on Tuesday 28 August.  More games against Suffolk followed. A number of teams representing the county existed in the 18th and 19th centuries. The present club was founded on 14 October 1876 and played its first matches in 1877. The county joined the Minor Counties Championship when it was formed in 1895. It missed the 1896 season, and also did not compete in 1902 and 1903, but otherwise has remained at that level ever since. Honours [ edit ] Norfolk has won the Minor Counties Championship five times, two of them shared. It won the first Championship in 1895, sharing with Durham and Worcestershire . It won outright in 1905, 1910 and 1913. Its most recent success was a shared title with Herefordshire in 2002. Norfolk has won the MCCA Knockout Trophy a record five times since its inception in 1983, winning in 1986, 1997, 2001, 2005 and 2009.
