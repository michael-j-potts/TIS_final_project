Returning to the Championship proper in 2008 , Hertfordshire have since played in the lower divisions of the structure, achieving their best performance in 2016 , when they won Division Four North & East. In the Women's Twenty20 Cup , which they joined for its inaugural season in 2009 , Hertfordshire have fared similarly, playing mostly in Division 3. In 2012 , they had a chance at promotion from South Division 2, but lost to Essex in the Division final, whilst they finished 2nd in Division 3C in 2017 , with six wins from eight games. In 2020, after the county season was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic , Hertfordshire competed in the East of England Championship , and won the 45-over competition. In 2021 , they won the East Group of the Twenty20 Cup, going unbeaten with 5 victories and 3 matches abandoned due to rain. They also again competed in the East of England Championship, finishing second in the 45-over competition to Buckinghamshire . They finished second in their group of the 2022 Women's Twenty20 Cup , and again finished second in the East of England Championship.
