List of historically significant English cricket teams
2022-05-19 00:00:00
The purpose of this list is to identify all historically significant English cricket clubs and teams which played in significant matches, some of which may have been given first-class status . It concentrates on those which are now defunct or not currently significant. The list, therefore, excludes County Championship clubs, Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), touring teams and the main university clubs. Clubs in the Minor Counties Cricket Championship or in one of the ECB Premier Leagues are excluded unless they formerly played in important or first-class matches. Note that some clubs which folded were subsequently refounded as modern league clubs. Many of the teams were ad hoc units or "scratch teams" named after their organiser (e.g., Alfred Shaw's XI ) while others are combinations (e.g., London & Surrey ). The total column gives the number of matches that the team is known to have played in. In the source column, if only one citation is given, it relates to the earliest known mention of the team in the surviving records. N.B. The list is believed complete for clubs and teams that were active in significant cricket up to 1825. Many clubs and teams post-1825 are already included but they are not exhaustive.

Haygarth in S&B calls it " Hambledon Club with Lumpy versus Kent". The venue, in Surrey, was neutral. Haygarth says he saw the alphabetical title in other sources. 1831–1833 A to K Lord's 2 notes The two "A to K" versus "L to Z" matches in 1831 and 1833 were among the few genuine alphabetical matches. They were both played at Lord's by teams of MCC members supplemented by a few leading professionals including Jem Broadbridge , William Lillywhite , Fuller Pilch and Ned Wenman . The 1833 match was 12-a-side. 1787–1789 A to M Lord's Old Ground and Bourne Paddock 5 notes According to CricketArchive , teams called "A to M" and "N to Z" played each other five times in three seasons from 1787. The main secondary source for the five matches is Scores & Biographies which calls the two teams " Earl of Winchilsea's Side " and " Sir Horace (Horatio) Mann's Side ". There is nothing in Scores and Biographies to suggest that the teams were organised alphabetically. See the entries below for Earl of Winchilsea's XI and Sir Horatio Mann's XI . 1733 Acton & Ealing notes 1743–1752 Addington notes 1746 Addington & Bromley notes 1747 Addington & Croydon notes 1745–1746 Addington & Lingfield notes 1811 Benjamin Aislabie's XI notes 1846–1881 All-England Eleven (AEE) notes 1775 Alphabetical Artillery Ground and Moulsey Hurst 2 notes This refers to two matches organised by the Duke of Dorset and the Earl of Tankerville in May 1775, the first one played at the Artillery Ground and the return at Moulsey Hurst two days later. Details of the teams are unknown and so it cannot be said which letters of the alphabet applied to each team. All that is known is that the patrons made two "Grand Alphabetical Matches". 1776–1785 Alresford notes 1782 Alresford & Odiham notes 1780–1784 Alton & Odiham notes 1789 S. Amherst's XI notes 1919 Army and Navy notes 1702 Arundel Bury Hill aka Berry Hill 1 notes It is believed that the Arundel club was formally constituted in 1704 but, two years earlier, an Arundel team took part in a match against a team raised by Charles Lennox, 1st Duke of Richmond . The venue for that match is unknown but Arundel's ground at Bury Hill was in use for other important matches through much of the 18th century. The Arundel club remains active at league level in Sussex. B [ edit ] known dates team name home or used venue total source 1805–1832 Bs notes 1822 Bakewell notes 1907–1909 J.

The results of the matches are unknown. 1742–1808 Bromley notes 1743 Bromley & Chislehurst notes 1749 Bromley & London notes 1747 Bromley & Ripley notes 1741–1785 Buckinghamshire notes Richard Grenville was the county's first patron and captain for a match against Northamptonshire . 1816–1818 E.

Capel's XI notes 1923 Capped (in Capped v Uncapped match at Hastings) notes 1767–1770 Caterham notes 1769 Caterham & Coulsdon notes c.1611 Chalkhill unknown 1 notes A team with this name took part in the world's earliest known organised match at Chevening, Kent against opponents called Weald and Upland . 1731 Thomas Chambers' XI notes 1705–1773 Chatham unknown 2 notes The first reference to a team from Chatham, Kent , is a match against West of Kent in 1705, one of the earliest known important matches. There is a specific reference to a "Chatham Club" re a single wicket match in 1754. In the last quarter of the 18th century, Chatham was mainly associated with George Louch and is believed to have used a ground owned by him for its home matches, though there are references in 1785 and 1787 to Chatham Lines as a venue. There are some 19th century references but the Chatham club ultimately folded and there is no real modern equivalent, not even in Kent league cricket. The town of Chatham is famous historically for the Royal Dockyard but it is not known if there was any connection between the dockyard and the cricket club. 1731–1789 Chelsea Chelsea Common 4 notes Chelsea Common virtually disappeared under building work in the 19th century. Records have survived of five important matches between 1731 and 1789 which involved the Chelsea club and/or were played on the common. The first, played on the common for the high stake of 50 guineas , was Chelsea v Fulham on Tuesday, 13 July 1731. Fulham won. There was a return at Parsons Green on Tuesday, 10 August 1731, which Fulham won by 3 runs . On Tuesday, 26 June 1733, Fulham again hosted Chelsea at Parsons Green, this time for 30 guineas, but the result of this match is unknown. On Monday, 16 August 1736, there was an inter-county match on the common between Middlesex and Surrey . The stake was 50 guineas and Middlesex won by 9 runs. The last match found in the records was on Thursday, 10 and Friday, 11 September 1789 when Chelsea played Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in Marlborough Gardens, Chelsea. This match, which was of dubious status, was probably drawn after a postponement. 1731 Chelsfield notes 1736–1784 Chertsey notes 1762 Chertsey & Dartford notes 1822–1855 Cheshire notes 1724–1726 Chingford unknown 1 notes In 1724, Edwin Stead 's XI v Chingford ended early because the Chingford team refused to play to a finish when Stead's team had the advantage. Lord Chief Justice Pratt presided over the ensuing court case and ordered the teams, as in the London v Rochester match in 1718, to play it out so that all wagers could be fulfilled. The game was completed in 1726 but the final result is not on record. Chingford's involvement is the earliest known reference to Essex cricket but the 1724 venue is uncertain and so not definitely the first match played in the county. 1738–1746 Chislehurst notes 1746 Chislehurst & London notes 1927 Civil Service notes 1920–1946 Combined Services aka Services XI notes 1832 Sir St Vincent Cotton's XI notes 1771–1784 Coulsdon notes 1751 Country XI notes 1787–1788 Coventry notes 1923–1924 Lord Cowdray's XI notes 1707–1798 Croydon Duppas Hill 23 notes A leading club in the 1730s, especially, when it was sometimes representative of Surrey as a county. D [ edit ] known dates team name home or used venue total source 1786 D to Z aka Rest of the Alphabet Moulsey Hurst 1 notes D to Z played against A to C, which was in fact a Kent Eleven and it was a curiosity that they selected only players whose names began with A, B or C while their D to Z opponents, who were in fact a Hampshire team with given men, selected only players whose names did not begin A, B or C. Haygarth in S&B calls it " Hambledon Club with Lumpy versus Kent". The venue, in Surrey, was neutral. Haygarth says he saw the alphabetical title in other sources. 1870–1880 Richard Daft's XI notes 1790–1795 Earl of Darnley's XI notes 1722–1808 Dartford notes 1896 Earl de la Warr's XI notes 1896 C. de Trafford's XI notes 1919 Demobilised Officers notes 1752 Deptford notes 1743–1748 Deptford & Greenwich notes 1746–1749 Stephen Dingate’s XI notes 1769–1790 3rd Duke of Dorset's XI notes 1753 Dover notes 1895–1926 Dublin University notes 1858–1861 Durham & Yorkshire notes E [ edit ] known dates team name home or used venue total source 1874–1948 East notes 1788 G. East's XI notes 1781–1790 East Kent Bourne Paddock 7 notes Although sometimes correctly named "East Kent", some of the teams should more properly be called Sir Horatio Mann's XI . All seven of the matches were against the West Kent equivalent managed by either John Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset or Stephen Amherst . 1822 East Kent & Sussex notes 1787–1824 East Sussex notes 1746–1752 Edmonton notes 1881–1883 Tom Emmett's XI notes 1731 Enfield notes 1814–1823 Epsom notes 1737–1808 Essex notes 1732 Essex & Hertfordshire notes 1731 Ewell notes F [ edit ] known dates team name home or used venue total source 1782–1786 Farnham notes 1840–1849 Fast bowlers XI (Fast v Slow matches) notes 1747–1753 Tom Faulkner's XI notes 1846 Nicholas Felix's XI notes 1819 First Letters notes 1786 Five Parishes notes 1912–1919 H.

In a 1729 match against Edwin Stead 's XI, Gage's XI is believed to have achieved the earliest known innings victory. 1806–1962 Gentlemen notes 1869–1879 Gentlemen & Players XI notes 1751–1961 Gentlemen of England notes 1771–1889 Gentlemen of Hampshire notes 1771–1892 Gentlemen of Kent notes 1855 Gentlemen of Kent & Surrey notes 1857 Gentlemen of Kent & Sussex notes 1729 Gentlemen of London 1 notes Played a single match against the Gentlemen of Middlesex.

Gibbon's XI notes 1925; 1958–66 A. E. R. Gilligan's XI Central Recreation Ground , Hastings 12 notes An occasional team formed by Arthur Gilligan which played in one match against L. H. Tennyson's XI in 1925 during Gilligan's playing career. Gilligan reformed the team in 1958 for a match against the international tourists (New Zealand in 1958) at Hastings. This became an annual fixture at Hastings until 1966 and Gilligan's team also played against Sussex. 1877 Gloucestershire & Yorkshire notes 1821–1825 Godalming notes 1871–1907 W. G.

Lloyd's XI notes 1886–1913 Lord Londesborough's XI notes 1707–1800 London Artillery Ground numerous notes There is mention of a London club in 1722 but its foundation date is unknown and the teams which represented London in the early 18th century could have been ad hoc formations. London from the 1730s to the 1750s should be considered the equivalent of a county team as it was different to the Middlesex and Surrey teams it sometimes opposed. It is most famously associated with the Artillery Ground and was especially prominent in the heyday of single wicket cricket in the 1740s. The original London club faded in the 1760s and 1770s when it was superseded by Hambledon as the focal point of the sport; its last known important match was against its old rivals Dartford in 1778. From 1788, there was another London team, possibly unconnected with the original club, which competed against MCC and Middlesex in several matches to 1798. After that, there is a sole reference to a team called London playing a one-off match against Thames Ditton in 1800. Few details have survived of London's players but they included Ellis (accredited the club's "best bowler"); leading batsmen Little and Tall Bennett; and the noted single wicket players Thomas Jure and John Capon. 1940–1945 London Counties notes 1900–1904 London County notes 1735–1770 London & Middlesex notes 1743 London, Middlesex & Surrey notes 1726–1758 London & Surrey Kennington Common 7 notes Teams called London & Surrey were formed occasionally in the 18th century, playing as a combined team, mostly against Kent sides at times when Kent was deemed to be the strongest county. The combined team played one match versus Addington & Lingfield in 1746. 1744–1749 Long Robin's XI notes 1793 George Louch's XI notes 1890 Lyric Club notes M [ edit ] known dates team name home or used venue total source 1775–1781 Maidenhead notes 1774 Maidstone notes 1816–1864 Manchester notes 1768–1795 Sir Horatio Mann's XI notes 1886 Lord March's XI notes 1733–1892 Married XI (Married v Single matches) notes 1777 Sir H.

Newman's XI notes 1739 – Non-international England cricket teams ("All England", "The Rest", etc.) various many notes Non-international England teams are often referred to simply as "England" or as "All England" but the term typically means "The Rest of England" (often abbreviated to "The Rest") vis-à-vis their opponents who might be MCC or a county club. There were specific variations on the "All England" theme, especially William Clarke's All-England Eleven (1846–1881), which was commonly known as the All-England Eleven or AEE. Others were the United All-England Eleven (UEE; 1852–1869), the United North of England Eleven (UNEE; 1870–1881) and the United South of England Eleven (USEE; 1865–1880). 1884 Non-smokers XI (Smokers v Non-smokers match) notes 1764–1851 Norfolk notes 1836–1961 North notes 1741 Northamptonshire notes First recorded as part of the combined Northants/Hunts team in two matches against Bedfordshire and then, shortly afterwards, singly against Buckinghamshire .

Most of Sheffield's matches were against other town clubs, notably Manchester and Nottingham , but they called themselves Yorkshire when facing county opposition. The first " Roses Match " against Lancashire took place on 23–25 July 1849, Yorkshire winning by 5 wickets. Yorkshire County Cricket Club was formed on 8 January 1863 at a meeting of the Match Fund Committee which had been established two years earlier by the Sheffield club for the promotion of inter-county matches. 1828 Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire & Leicestershire Darnall New Ground 1 notes An ad hoc team which was formed to play one match only against All-England at Darnall on 8 to 10 September 1828, All-England winning by 242 runs. The match arose from a challenge made by William Woolhouse on behalf of the northern counties to the rest of England. It backfired as the combined team, which featured Tom Marsden , could manage only 92 runs in the entire match against the roundarm bowling of Jem Broadbridge and William Lillywhite , while Fuller Pilch scored 49 and 56 for a personal match total of 105.
