The benefactor, Sir John Maple , the owner of Maple's furniture store in Tottenham Court Road and who lived at nearby Childwickbury , donated the land and paid for the laying out, the planting and the construction of the buildings; the layout of the park itself was designed by the City Surveyor, Mr G. Ford. A striking water fountain, which can still be seen today, was donated by Lady Maple. The park was opened on 23 July 1894 by the Duke of Cambridge , a member of the Royal family , and the event was accompanied by great celebrations in the city of St Albans. The sports ground hosts cricket, hockey, bowls and croquet and is also the home of St Albans City Football Club .
