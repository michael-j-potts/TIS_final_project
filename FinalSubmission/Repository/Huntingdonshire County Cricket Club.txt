The earliest reference to the game in the general region is in neighbouring Cambridgeshire at the University of Cambridge in 1710. In 1741, John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich became patron and captain of a Huntingdonshire county team which, as part of a united Northamptonshire & Huntingdonshire team, twice defeated Bedfordshire in important matches . Origin of the club [ edit ] Huntingdonshire County Cricket Club was first formed in 1831 and existed until 1895. Initially, until the early 1850s, matches were played against club sides but from the start of the 1850s the club found regular County opponents . Up until 1874 Huntingdonshire played home matches at Millers Holme, Godmanchester . From 1874 the club played at the Huntingdon Cricket Club Ground and continues to do so to this day.  In 1895 the club was disbanded. In the 1920s the club was briefly reformed before folding once again. The current county club was formed in 1948. From 1999 to 2003, the county entered teams into the English domestic one-day competition , matches which had List A status .  The county played seven List A matches during this period, with the final List A match it played coming against Cheshire . During this period, the club used The Parks, Godmanchester as its home ground.
